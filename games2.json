They ignore each other as much as possible and they seem resentful, almost like they’re here on detention. And why are the cool kids, the loners and the nerds all here together, skating dully in a circle? The people watching from the sidelines are equally mismatched: the rink employees, tired of renting skates and selling hot dogs; the retired roller derby pros, bored by the lack of violence; and the town prudes, obsessed with the possibility that the teens might start enjoying themselves or even worse—dancing. Suddenly, there is a scream. The body of Kevin Floosey, the new kid in town, has been found in the back hallway. It looks like someone strangled him with a leg warmer. Who could have done such a terrible thing to a guy who just wanted to dance… or is that really all he wanted? Who knows? Maybe YOU killed him!",

That is, until patriarch of the DeBubbles family fortune, grandpa Delroy DeBubbles, winds up dead! Who could have executed such a dastardly plot on such a happy occasion? Was it Delroy’s second wife, Babette DeBubbles? Or perhaps the head winemaker for the rival LeCorque family, Monte Pulciano? Could it have been a disgruntled patron, like Reese Ling or employee, Mary Tage? There’s only one way to find out - play Murder By Midnight! But hold onto your champagne because the killer could be YOU! Appropriate for ages 13+! This game takes 1-2 hours to play depending on your group size.",

Everyone wants to know: “Who invited us here?” “Who assigned us our mask colors?” “Who would throw such a lavish party in a haunted house?” No one has answers—they only know that they were instructed to be here, or their secrets would be revealed to the world. One by one, they are called to the study to meet with the unknown host. After each meeting, a subdued guest shuffles out, muttering that “somebody should kill that guy!” The party continues with guests sullenly milling about and waiting for the host’s next ugly surprise. The clock strikes midnight. On the twelfth chime, the study door flies open and a man cloaked in black stumbles out. “One of you did this! One of you—” He gasps and falls to the ground, dead, with a knife protruding from his back. His mask falls too, revealing the face of Ispil DeBeens, local historian and investigative reporter. A cold wind blows through the room; the doors slam and lock shut. Howling is heard from every corner. The guests are trapped here with the ghosts that infest the manor! They stare at each other, wondering which of them had a secret so precious that it led to murder. YOU are one those guests. DID YOU DO IT?? Appropriate for ages 16+!

    "description": "You are one of a group of thrill-seeking tourists gathered for a Halloween night ghost tour. You huddle close together as the howling wind swirls dead leaves around the five historic houses in the square. Four of them are guaranteed to be haunted by murder victims from decades past; the fifth house is where the tour starts and costumed actors re-enact the crimes that created the ghosts. The Tour Guide leads you up the dim creaking staircase and turns you loose to explore the upper floor. Screams punctuate the silence as the actors jump out of their hiding places to portray murderers and victims. Suddenly, one more scream is heard and a heavy weight tumbles down the stairs. When the Security Guard turns on the lights, you can see the lifeless body of the Tour Guide sprawled on the lower landing. Somebody has pushed her—but who? And why? Appropriate for ages 13+! This game takes 1-2 hours to play depending on your group size.",

He is hosting a grand dinner for the royal couple and has invited several influential families from nearby. Hopeful young ladies are in attendance to find a wealthy husband. Wealthy young men are avoiding the gold-digging ladies and their pushy mothers. The less fortunate young men are in search of a young lady of large fortune. At the height of the party, someone screams. Lord Bertram, is in his study, slumped over and dead as a doornail. Who is responsible for Lord Bertram's death? Was it one of the mothers of the young ladies, who have been fruitlessly trying to marry their daughters to any one of Lord Bertram's sons? Did someone murder him for his money? Or did the butler do it? The game is afoot, both upstairs AND downstairs, at the Ridgerton Park estate- so watch out! The killer may even be you! Appropriate for ages 16+!

Who could have ended such a promising young woman’s life so brutally (and publicly)? Was it her oddball older sister, Patricia “Petty” Lodesacash, driven wild by jealousy? Or was it her rival belle of the ball, Quinn Quick? Was it notable southern playboy Shep Sheppard, or one of the Whitehead twins? Dust off your tuxedo jacket, pour yourself a mint julep, and get ready to come out to society in MURDER AT THE DEBUTANTE BALL. Appropriate for ages 16+!",

Three championship teams are playing tonight. The usual announcer, Mello Tones, is emceeing, joined by tonight’s special guest host, the strangely elfin Potto Golde. The pub owner, Undine Thumb, is trying to keep the crowd happy with free green beads to wear and cheap green beer to guzzle, but there’s a strange undercurrent beneath the wild shenanigans. Suddenly there is a scream. One of the barmaids has found the body of Undine Thumb in the back hallway, crushed by kegs of green beer. It was murder! Whodunit? An oppressed employee, a sore pub quiz loser, a mysterious stranger… or was it—YOU? Appropriate for ages 16+! This game takes 1-2 hours to play depending on your group size.",

Kids and adults can both enjoy this enchanted game featuring creatures like fairies, dragons, mermaids, and of course the Easter Bunny! Who might have taken the magical golden egg- and why?! Was it the Easter Bunny's jealous and aspirational younger sibling, Hop P. Bunny? Could one of the summit attendees be hiding something, like a desperate desire for MORE magic? Maybe someone thought that the gold could be turned around for some quick cash? There’s only one way to find out who did it- play THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING GOLDEN EGG! Appropriate for ages 10+! This game takes 1-2 hours to play depending on your group size.",

What seems to be a tragic accident now looks more and more like a Hollywood hit job.  Who could have bumped off this heartthrob of the silver screen? Could it have been controlling director Burly Bellows, frustrated with Mandrake’s lack of elocution?  Or was it his vengeful scene-stealing scene partner, emerging starlet Nettie Potts?

Pour yourself a glass of giggle water and do the Bunny Hug in this legendary Jazz Age whodunit, TERROR IN TINSELTOWN.",

Who could be responsible for ending her life so soon?  Could it be Wet N’ Wild’s charismatic founder and borderline cult leader Dr. Leo Jungles?  Or park financier and oil magnate Tex Loophole?  What about the animal rights activist and founder of the Big Cat preserve, Carolina Pesky? There’s only one way to find out: play Murder at the Wet N’ Wild Animal Sanctuary!

Someone invited M’sieur Geezaire, an old-timer who claims to know everything about Mardi Gras traditions. That’s too bad, because Geezaire won’t shut up. His nonstop droning is boring everyone to tears. Then he launches into a new story, all about a humiliating, embarrassing event among last year’s tourists. Luckily, the first float approaches with its booming zydeco music and the host dims the lights. In the darkness, there is a lot of shuffling around… a strange gurgling sound… and a thud. When the lights come back on, M’sieur Geezaire is lying dead on the floor, strangled with his own Mardi Gras beads. Whodunit? Clearly, someone in the room didn’t want that embarrassing story finished. Could it have been—YOU?",

The idea for the event came from a vampiric philanthropist who claims to want nothing more than to see vampires and humans get together for a quick bite and a special night. Who needs a lovey-dovey romantic evening? This is a dating event set up to match Vampires with Humans, the first of it's kind. For those who think Valentine's Day sucks, this event promised unforgettable no-strings-attached excitement, but no one could have foretold a death! At the height of the party, someone screamed and stepped back to reveal the crumpled body of the host, LeBrat de Tigercub, one of the wealthiest and most powerful vampires in all of New England. Who is responsible for slaying this bloodsucker? Was it someone who LeBrat repeatedly refused to turn into a vampire? Was it the Spencer twins, bent on revenge? Or, was it Martino de Sanguino, head of a well-to-do and powerful coven, seeking to expand his domain? The stakes are high in Stupid Cupid: Love Bites, so watch out! The killer may even be you!",

They and their handlers are nervously waiting for the Head Judge to arrive and determine which dog is the “Best in Show.” The Announcer introduces the Judge. She does not appear. The Announcer tries again. Silence. Suddenly, a minor official runs screaming into the ring. “Dead! She’s dead! Someone has killed Ada Glover!” In the ensuing chaos, the crowd is left to wonder whodunit. Was it one of the finalists, scared of how the Judge would assess their precious pooch? Was it someone who was passed over for a place in the finals? Was it one of the dog fanciers in the audience? Or was it—YOU?",

Each camp offers a wide variety of activities like competitive sports, arts, and wilderness exploration, culminating in the Great Swampland Olympics on the last day of summer. Whichever camp wins the most events takes home the coveted Calamine Trophy. But this year, someone has stolen the Trophy! Was it one the kids, playing tricks?
